### Specs

* _As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs._
* _For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and flavor_
* _As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list._
* _As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake._
* _As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg._
* _As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1._
* _As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them_
* _As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability_
